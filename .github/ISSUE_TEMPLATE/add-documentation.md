[QUERY]

#### Consider following content as response input and output 
  >This should be in a flow already

* ***Output in form*** 
  * Predefined, short and relevant AI prompts  (dropdown, tag, or label?)
  * Easy-to-use and modify. Run it where you want it
  * Formats content / output to match syntax (in best way)
